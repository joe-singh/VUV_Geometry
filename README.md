# VUV_Geometry
VUV Geometry 

## Use:

At the command line:
1. python Main.py 
2. rat photon.mac -o output.root
3. python photonTracking.py output.root

Main.py controls all the geometry and creates a file called VUV.geo, which the photon.mac macro needs to 
simulate. This macro simulates (100,000) photons and stores their track information and writes it to output.root. 
photonTracking.py reads this output file and does a simple 3d scatterplot of the start and eventual endpoints of photons. 

photonTracker.cc is the updated photon tracking macro which correctly plots the termination points of the photons. To use this, open a root session and then in the root prompt do

.x photonTracker.cc("output.root") where output is replaced by whatever filename has the track information. 

This produces a view of the XZ plane (the incident photons coming out of the page) and the YZ plane (photons going left to
right). There is also a histogram of incident wavelength vs wavelength at photodiode (do log y scale) and number of tracks
with multiple steps as sanity checks.

geoShapes.py is the class made by Chris that contains all the shape information about Tubes and Boxes, as well as
borders between shapes. OPTICS.ratdb is the file containing all the material information. 

raytrace.mac is the file used to visualise (rat raytrace.mac)
